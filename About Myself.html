<b style="color: red;font-size: 22px">My Strengths</b>

In compare to studies, I am good at E-sports. so I am the captain of my team. I am the best E-sports player at my team. Besides this, I am a Make-up Artist 
also and I love fashion designer & public figure.I also love travels and hang out.

The advice of my parents had a keen effect on my habits. I believe to speak the truth and try my best not to lie. My parents always advised me that if I 
commit a mistake, I should admit it. I try my best to do so. I know how to remain happy in every condition. 
Because I believe that: “Happiness is not out there; it’s in you.”

I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk. I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again. Learning new 
things is one thing which I always enjoy. I always update myself with the news.

<b style="color: green;font-size: 22px">My Weaknesses</b>

As every man have weaknesses, so have also. I am a little bit lazy at some places 
which I do not like. While playing time, I pass my lot of time there which is not a good habit, but I try my best to overcome my weaknesses.

<b style="color: grey;font-size: 22px">My Ambitions in Life</b>

Everybody has an ambition in life. Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of man. No man can do anything in the world without aim. So, all of us should 
be very determined about our aim in life.

Without good career planning, right from the start, one can’t be on the right track. One has to set the goals in accordance with his or her broad career goals.

I am studying in Computer Science & Engineering and I will seat for the competitive entrance for become a CSE Engineer. I shall try to be a good and 
honest student. Then I shall be a qualified Engineer. I will do all that to be a good Engineer and will be sincere to it.

<b style="color: purple;font-size: 22px">Conclusion</b>

These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences. One needs to have yet command of oneself before 
going to write something about his life. Life is meant to be lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings. Keeping this aim in mind,
 I have always desired to serve my people in whatever capacity I can.If you are interested in knowing more, Please visit  my <button style="background-color: pink"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Arfeen.Rhea" target="_blank">Facebook</a></button> or take a look at
